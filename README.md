# Description

Messaging Software developed using Python, PyQt5 framework and Socket Programming

# Working

This Repository contains two Applications, Application with UI interface and Application with cmd interface. Working of both are different from other. In Application with cmd interface
each message is sent to Server and then Server broadcast it. In application with UI interface Server provides all Users with connected Users list. Each User can chat
with as many people he wants. For each communication new message window will be created. During messaging end-to-end Socket is created between two Users 
and all messages are sent through this socket. When message window is closed Socket is destroyed.
